    <p>Hi, I'm Natalie Castillo, a UX/UI Designers. I specialize in user research and visual design.
    </p>
    <p>
    What I enjoy most about UX/UI Design, is that it's a user focused field; putting the user and their needs at the forefront of the final products intention. 
    </p>   
        Coming from an interior design background that is client centric, I have concentrated on creating spaces tailored to their lifestyles. Since UX/UI focuses on the user's needs, I believe I would be able to assist in problem solving and bringing design ideas to fruition.
    </p> 
    <p>
        I'm inspired by everyday life, people, music, my dogs and travel.
